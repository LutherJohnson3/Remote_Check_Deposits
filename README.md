# Remote_Check_Deposits
“If you have ever deposited a check into your banking account via your smartphone; you’re welcome.”  
I led a UX team that pioneered an early iteration of software that allows users to deposit checks remotely.  Today, that software is licensed to most banks across the country.  Most USAA Federal Savings Bank customers are active United States military members.  Bank branches are not available to them.  A solution was necessary to enable military personnel to remotely deposit their checks and pay their bills.
